*Overview*

The Sign Language Translator project leverages computer vision and machine learning to recognize and transcribe sign language gestures into text. This tool is intended to aid communication by providing a real-time translation of sign language, enhancing accessibility for non-hearing individuals.

*Project Structure*

Sign language transcription.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for gesture recognition, preprocessing, model training, and transcription.

data/: (Optional) Directory where the dataset used for training the model is stored.

models/: (Optional) Directory to save and load trained machine learning models.

*Setup and Installation*

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-transcription.git

cd sign-language-transcription

Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required packages by running:


Download or Prepare the Dataset:

If the dataset is provided, place it in the data/ directory.

Alternatively, you can prepare your dataset for training by following the instructions in the notebook.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:

jupyter notebook

Open the Sign language transcription.ipynb notebook to begin.

*Usage*

Data Preprocessing:

The notebook includes code for preprocessing gesture images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.


Model Training:

Train the model using the provided dataset. The notebook covers various aspects of training, including model selection, tuning, and evaluation.


Transcription:

After training, use the model to transcribe new sign language gestures into text. The notebook provides code for loading a trained model and performing real-time transcription.


Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the model on a test set to ensure accuracy and reliability.
